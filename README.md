# AI-Music
Music is Life. As university years comes to an end, I and my partners have decided to create something unique and special
during our senior design semester. Thus, AI-Music was launched. 

The project was developed by a team of nine members. Please see below.
An artificial intelligence driven music player has won the first place in senior desgin competition
for the team.
